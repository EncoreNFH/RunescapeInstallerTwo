# RunescapeInstallerTwo
The second itteration of the Runescape Installer, this time with a proper Runescape theme. As per usual:
DO NOT RUN THIS ON ANY MACHINE YOU WANT TO STILL USE, IT WILL ENCRYPT YOUR HARDDRIVE WITH A RANDOM AES-256 PASSWORDED ENCRYPTION.

Appears as a Runescape Installer. Changes your wallpaper, deletes your master boot record, and encrypts files on your hard drive. 
The encryption key is generated using a randomly generated 16 character string, which is then put into a derivation function in order to generate an AES-256 key.
Since the password is a new one every time, file decryption is as far as I know impossible.
